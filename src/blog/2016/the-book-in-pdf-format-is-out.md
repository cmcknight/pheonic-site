<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Hurray! I finally got to push the big blue Publish button at Leanpub to get the PDF version of the book out. I'm working on the ePub/mobi versions now and hope to get those out by the end of the month on Leanpub, Apple store, and Amazon. I plan to keep the price the same on Apple and Amazon, but the royalties are a bit smaller so if you want to help the kids the most, buy the book on Leanpub at this [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190414105752/https://leanpub.com/agitr_v1).

Remember, all of the proceeds from the sales of the book go to fund robotics programs for kids so please help if you can!
