After having shuttered Pheonic nearly eight years ago, I have finally rebuilt the site as a personal site. As such, I've moved my blog articles on robotics over from the now-defunct Robotic Ramblings blog as a start and I will be making a concerted effort to get back to writing more often.

One of the first articles I'm going to write about is the approach I took in building the site, which involves the use of a static site generator, [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). It is a relatively new static site generator but is under active development and the community is both friendly and helpful. Props to Zach Leatherman and the crew for a first-rate system.

In any case, I'm going to try the *shorter is better* approach for blogging with the goal of trying write at least one article a week.
