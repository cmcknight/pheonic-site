        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
            <p><a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a> is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that originally supported school gardens and provided education geared towards hands-on learning for those interested in urban and rural agriculture. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, Farmer Frog has shifted its focus to that of providing food for over 1.5 million people across the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2020, I met with Szabi Pasztor, the Director of IT, to discuss his needs for a new website. The original website was built using WordPress, but the team that had been maintaining it had moved on. Additionally, the performance of the host was lacking so from this discussion and careful analysis of the current and future needs, we agreed to move the site to Amazon Web Services and to rewrite the site using the <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> static site generator.</p>
