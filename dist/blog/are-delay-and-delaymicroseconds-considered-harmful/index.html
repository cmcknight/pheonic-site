            <p>One of the big things I've noticed in a lot of the Arduino tutorials is the use of delay() and delayMicroseconds(). Both of these methods are &quot;blocking&quot; calls that literally stop the operation of the microprocessor until they complete. Apparently a lot of folks aren't aware of the millis() and micros() timer functions which are non-blocking so I wrote a small utility object named ActionTimer that uses the millis() method and published it on Github <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190414105803/https://github.com/senestone/ActionTimer">link</a>. It seems to work well for me but of course, your mileage may vary. More interestingly is that I have seen the same thing pop up for the FTC teams using the FTC SDK in Java, so it is apparently not an uncommon situation.</p>
