        In my first book I avoided the IR Transmit and Receive devices other than using the included IR remote that comes with the mBot. Some of that had to do with not being able to get the test programs in Scratch to work, but a lot of it was more because I couldn't think of an application for a single mBot. That's still the case, but I've got an idea for an application with two or more mBots that will appear in volume 2 of the &quot;A Gentle Introduction to Robotics&quot; series. That being said, I wanted to share a couple of test apps that I've written  so that you can go forth and be creative if you have a couple of mBots (and really, who wouldn't want to have two?).

        The writing for volume 2 has been on the back burner due to my coaching a First Technology Challenge team. The team members are all in middle (7th-8th grade) and have been doing well for their first year. The team managed to place second in their league and second in the Inter-League competition so now they will be competing at the state level in a couple of weeks. Whether or not they will continue to advance is sort of unknown, but it's been quite interesting to see how they evolve as a team and how the robot has evolved.
