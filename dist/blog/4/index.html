        Hurray! I finally got to push the big blue Publish button at Leanpub to get the PDF version of the book out. I'm working on the ePub/mobi versions now and hope to get those out by the end of the month on Leanpub, Apple store, and Amazon. I plan to keep the price the same on Apple and Amazon, but the royalties are a bit smaller so if you want to help the kids the most, buy the book on Leanpub at this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190414105752/https://leanpub.com/agitr_v1">link</a>.

        Having taught a class or two using the mBot, I decided that it would be a &quot;Good Idea&quot; to capture things into an ebook which I've titled &quot;A Gentle Introduction to Robotics.&quot; It should be available by the end of April barring any unforeseen circumstances and I'm trying to keep the price around $17.50 USD by going through Leanpub. All of the proceeds from the sale will go into an account to fund local robotics teams so if you want to help out future roboticists you can think about buying a copy. Or two. I'm also working with Leanpub to be able to make bulk discounts and/or discount coupons available for teachers and clubs.

        OK, so I've learned lots about the mBot and mBlock programming since my last post.
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>It is possible, with patience, to write highly readable programs in mBlock (Scratch 2.0).
The Makeblock team keeps improving mBlock.

        One of the exercises that I want to do with the mBot is to write a maze solving application in the mBlock environment. While it certainly would be easier to do in the native Arduino environment, I'm always up for a challenge. The mBlock environment is based on the Scratch 2.0 offline editor and is open source software. One of the issues with the Scratch 2.0 offline editor is that it is written in Adobe's proprietary ActionScript. Yes, you read that correctly, ActionScript. For Adobe Air. You know, the supposedly cross-platform environment that isn't supported under Linux (FAIL!@!). In any case, enough ranting about the choice of development language the MIT team has made, I have to live with it (for now).
