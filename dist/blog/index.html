        You know you're getting towards the end of the project when it's time to start putting your dev notes into documentation. In my case, the documentation for the <a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a> site has to cover a wide variety of topics for several different audiences. My initial thought was &quot;hey, I'll just store this stuff in a docs folder and call it good&quot;. That lasted for about three days until I realized that most developers would like to have a way to search docs for information.

        So I am down to the last few odds and ends on the <a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a> site migration from <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> to a static site built with <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> and the last big feature is the ability to do a full-text site search.

        Today I needed to create more pages for the <a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a> site that I am building in <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>. The site has a group of categories that have one or more posts associated with each category. Having recently discovered the joys of the <strong>before:</strong> property, I teed it up to solve this issue.

        I have mentioned in the past that I am using <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> for this blog and to build a site for a non-profit organization, <a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a>, that distributes food donations to 1.5+ million people across the Pacific Northwest. The blog is sort of my sandbox for testing things before I incorporate them into the Farmer Frog site. Farmer Frog had a blog at one point that was dropped because it was not getting many views. However there are some interesting articles on the blog so I have resuscitated it as part of the move from Wordpress to Eleventy.
