            <p>This was one of those scratch and itch projects because I have a lot of development projects that I do both professionally and as a hobby. Rather than try to remember where everything is and which tools I used to build them, I wrote PyDevMgr to keep track of that for me. I'm a huge fan of Albert Einstein's notion that I shouldn't have to remember all of the details, just where the details are stored (translation: I'm lazy).</p>
<p>So off I went and built PyDevMgr in Python 3.9 and wxPython so that I could use it on whatever platorm I happen to be on (and yes, I work across multiple operating systems so that's a necessity for me). After some time on the whiteboard, I settled on a two screen design that leans heavily towards simplicity.</p>
<h2>Main Screen</h2>
<p>The main screen (Figure 1) provides a wishful thinking UI that still needs some work for a few odds and ends <a href="fn1" id="fnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> but that will have to wait for another day.</p>
