                    I have mentioned in the past that I am using Eleventy for this blog and to build a site for a non-profit organization, <a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a>, that distributes food donations to 1.5+ million people across the Pacific Northwest. The blog is sort of my sandbox for testing things before I incorporate them into the Farmer Frog site. Farmer Frog had a blog at one point that was dropped because it was not getting many views. However there are some interesting articles on the blog so I have resuscitated it as part of the move from Wordpress to Eleventy.

                    I've managed to get a small modicum of free time opened up so I'm exploring a cross-platform framework for creating games and simulations called <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>. It is a complete IDE for creating games and simulations for Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, and Android. The Godot scripting language is Pythonish and fairly easy to learn. Godot provides all of the tools to create 2D and 3D games with as much complexity as one would like. To aid my learning, I'm using a <a href="https://udemy.com">Udemy</a> course named <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/godot/">Discovering Godot</a>. This course teaches Godot using the built-in GDScript, but Godot also supports C# development and that is discussed later in the course. My learning goal is to master Godot so that I can create simulations for my own projects and potentially clients as well.

                    Developers are lazy and good developers are <em><strong>really</strong></em> lazy. I do not say that to be disparaging. Good developers are always looking for a way to automate the grunt work (defined as anything that is repetitve). The tools used range from custom shell scripts to full-on automation suites in the endless quest to provide more time to focus on the important things in life. Like Apex or Fortnight.
