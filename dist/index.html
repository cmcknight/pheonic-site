                    One of the things I have always done to cement my knowledge in a programming language or environment is to write small applications using that language or in the particular environment. I have recently had to take up web development and thanks to Brad Traversy's courses on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=brad+traversy" target="_blank">Udemy</a> it has been a relatively painless experience. Okay, somewhat painless. There is still a world of difference in programming a web application that has to work across the multitude of screen sizes that are available today.

                    After having shuttered Pheonic nearly eight years ago, I have finally rebuilt the site as a personal site. As such, I've moved my blog articles on robotics over from the now-defunct Robotic Ramblings blog as a start and I will be making a concerted effort to get back to writing more often.

                    One of the areas that I passed over in the first volume of <a href="https://leanpub.com/agitr_v1"><em>A Gentle Introduction to Robotics</em></a> was the use of the infrared transmitter/receiver that is on the mBot. My original plan was to use it to facilitate inter-mBot communication so that at some point I could demonstrate simple swarm robotics. However, I ran into too many issues via mBlock (which have apparently been resolved with the current version) and it was preventing me from completing the book so I dropped that chapter with the intention of addressing those devices in the second volume of the series which focuses on native programming in the Arduino environment. While there are innumerable ways to make use of inter-mBot communications, I'll present a short video below of one mBot changing the color of its LEDs and sending the color to another mBot so that the other mBot can match colors with the first.
