                    The writing for volume 2 has been on the back burner due to my coaching a First Technology Challenge team. The team members are all in middle (7th-8th grade) and have been doing well for their first year. The team managed to place second in their league and second in the Inter-League competition so now they will be competing at the state level in a couple of weeks. Whether or not they will continue to advance is sort of unknown, but it's been quite interesting to see how they evolve as a team and how the robot has evolved.

                    OK, so I've learned lots about the mBot and mBlock programming since my last post.
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>It is possible, with patience, to write highly readable programs in mBlock (Scratch 2.0).
The Makeblock team keeps improving mBlock.

                    One of the exercises that I want to do with the mBot is to write a maze solving application in the mBlock environment. While it certainly would be easier to do in the native Arduino environment, I'm always up for a challenge. The mBlock environment is based on the Scratch 2.0 offline editor and is open source software. One of the issues with the Scratch 2.0 offline editor is that it is written in Adobe's proprietary ActionScript. Yes, you read that correctly, ActionScript. For Adobe Air. You know, the supposedly cross-platform environment that isn't supported under Linux (FAIL!@!). In any case, enough ranting about the choice of development language the MIT team has made, I have to live with it (for now).
