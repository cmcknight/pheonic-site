                    You know you're getting towards the end of the project when it's time to start putting your dev notes into documentation. In my case, the documentation for the <a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a> site has to cover a wide variety of topics for several different audiences. My initial thought was &quot;hey, I'll just store this stuff in a docs folder and call it good&quot;. That lasted for about three days until I realized that most developers would like to have a way to search docs for information.

                    This was one of those scratch and itch projects because I have a lot of development projects that I do both professionally and as a hobby. Rather than try to remember where everything is and which tools I used to build them, I wrote PyDevMgr to keep track of that for me. I'm a huge fan of Albert Einstein's notion that I shouldn't have to remember all of the details, just where the details are stored (translation: I'm lazy).

                    So I am down to the last few odds and ends on the <a href="https://farmerfrog.org">Farmer Frog</a> site migration from <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> to a static site built with <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> and the last big feature is the ability to do a full-text site search.
